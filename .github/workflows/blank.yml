# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, development ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, development ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!

    - name: Sphinx Build
      uses: ammaraskar/sphinx-action@0.4
      with:
        # The folder containing your sphinx docs.
        docs-folder: $DOC_ROOT
        # The command used to build your documentation.
        build-command: make html
        # Run before the build command, you can use this to install system level dependencies, for example with "apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y perl"
        pre-build-command: # optional
